# Angular2-AspNetCore
Demo of Angular 2 + ASP.NET Core 1.0 with Game of Thrones theme.

This demo is heavily inspired by Tour of Heroes at angular.io.

It uses Angular 2 as front-end, ASP.NET Core Web API as back-end and Entity Framework Core as database.

After cloning the project, you need to create database by running "update-database" from Package Manager Console, Angular2GOT database will be created.

If you need data, run "heroes-data.sql" script in scripts folder.
